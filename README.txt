If you're a complete newbie, here's how to start.


In your ba$h terminal: #'$' represents the bash terminal

1. $ npm install
2. spin up your postgres server
  ** if you don't have it, install it and run on the default port.
3. $ createdb express_facebook_auth_development
4. knex migrate:latest
5. then, $ node app
